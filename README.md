# random
A little game I developed in a few days (because I was lazy). You're "our favourite friend", trying to survive a canvas full of randomly moving, randomly coloured balls.
You move via the arrow keys.
The NPCs (Balls) are "powered" by:
  1. A genetic algorithm
  2. A weak AI (if I may say this), used to simply determine whether or not to follow you around.
DISCLAIMER: it's buggy as hell, but I'm too lazy to debug now. But the future is still a mistery, so yeah..
